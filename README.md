## User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

Ysra Spa is a service website for my first milestone project. This project is to show what I have learn from the three module HTML, CSS and User Centric fronted. This website of imaginary spa, provides variety of services or treatments for purpose of improving health, beauty and relaxation. I chose the theme of white background with green-yellow (Lime green) as the primary color, it is for the user and visitors of the site will feel relax as the color represent harmony, liesure, nature, restore energy, rejuvinate. Which what spa offers. It is a simple website yet well organized content that is easy to use.
